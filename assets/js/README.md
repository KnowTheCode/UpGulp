# JavaScript Assets

Minified and optimized scripts are for production, whereas the uncompressed, non-minified scripts are for development purposes.

This folder holds those uncompressed, non-minified scripts. By running `gulp scripts`, the scripts in this directory will be processed, minified, and saved in the theme/plugin's root `assets/js` folder.
